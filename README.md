# Optimised Multi-City European Travel Planner

Project Overview

This project provides an optimisation tool for planning cost-effective multi-city trips across Europe. It employs Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to minimise total travel and lodging expenses while adhering to user-defined constraints such as budget, trip duration, and preferred transportation and lodging options. The optimisation model is implemented using Python, specifically leveraging the Gurobi solver for ILP optimisation and Pandas for data preprocessing and manipulation.

There are 4 files included: 
- the 2 datasets used
- the prototype implementation
- the final report
